# `week` — Weekly Summary

Shows project totals for any week (Monday–Sunday). Defaults to the current week.

## Usage

```bash
tgp week                     # current week
tgp week --week -1           # last week
tgp week --week -3           # 3 weeks ago
tgp week --date 2026-04-01   # week containing Apr 1
tgp week -d yesterday        # week containing yesterday
tgp week --verbose           # current week with daily breakdown
tgp week -v --week -1        # last week with daily breakdown
```

### Flags

| Flag                | Shorthand       | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--week N`          | `-w N`          | Relative week offset (0 = current, -1 = last, 2 = two weeks ahead) |
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | `-d YYYY-MM-DD` | Show the week containing the given date (also accepts `yesterday`) |
| `--verbose`         | `-v`            | Show a per-day breakdown matrix for each project                   |

`--date` and `--week` are mutually exclusive. `--verbose` can be combined with either.
